## Visual Studio solution archive. ##

The project is designed to be used mostly under Linux or *BSD systems. However, if you are on Windows and want to quickly check the code under familiar Visual Studio environment, [**here**](https://glebnovodran.github.io/roam/roam_bench_vs.zip) is a self-contained archive with the VS solution, all the sources, data files and dependencies needed to build the code. But note that QJS support is currently not included in this distribution.

The Visual Studio solution and the project files from this archive are compatible with VS 2015+. When opening the solution with the versions newer than VS 2015, it might ask you to update the project - to switch to a newer SDK version.

## Windows binary. ##
If you'd like to just run the benchmark under Windows, [**here**](https://glebnovodran.github.io/roam/roam_bench_exe_x64.zip) is the archive containing a pre-compiled 64-bit executable.
